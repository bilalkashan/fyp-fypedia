        FYPedia is an innovative initiative by SZABIST, designed as a central portal for all Final Year Projects (FYPs). This platform is dedicated to supporting SZABIST students by providing a single, comprehensive source of information on past FYPs. Through FYPedia, students can access a vast archive of project documentation, videos, and essential details, which empowers them to refine their ideas, avoid duplication, and enhance the originality of their projects.

        FYPedia is more than just a repository—it’s a collaborative resource aimed at fostering creativity and knowledge-sharing within the SZABIST community. By offering detailed insights into previous projects, FYPedia serves as an invaluable tool for students, faculty, and researchers, promoting a culture of innovation and continuous improvement.
